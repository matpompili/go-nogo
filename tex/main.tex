\section{The NV centre as a quantum network node}

Quantum networks are expected to deliver definitive security for communication, blind quantum computation, improved clock synchronization and more exotic applications such as connecting far apart telescopes \cite{Wehner2018}.

A node of such a network needs to: 1) generate entangled states with other nodes, 2) manipulate quantum states and 3) store quantum states. The \ac{NV} centre in diamond is a promising candidate to act as node of such a network, as it fulfils all the mentioned requirements. Figure~\ref{fig:nv_summary} summarises the fundamental properties of the \ac{NV} centre.

\begin{figure}
	\missingfigure[figwidth=\textwidth, figheight=0.5\textwidth]{A nice figure to summarise the NV centre properties. Defect picture, level structure, optical transitions, coherence time, carbon control, entanglement.}
	\caption{The \ac{NV} centre as a quantum network node. a) The \ac{NV} is an atomic defect in diamond with trapped ion-like properties. b) Spin selective optical transitions allow for high-fidelity initialization and single-shot read-out. c) Neighbouring $C^{13}$ atoms can be used as quantum memories. d) Entanglement can be generated among remote \acp{NV}.}
	\label{fig:nv_summary}
\end{figure}

Recent work from our group demonstrated the on-demand generation of remote entanglement between two \ac{NV} centres with rates up to \SI{39}{\Hz} \cite{Humphreys2018}. Such high rates, three orders of magnitude higher than previous results on the same platform, are a consequence of moving from a two-photon detection protocol, such as the one used in Ref.~\cite{Hensen2015}, to a single-photon protocol.

Figure~\ref{fig:sce_scheme} summarises the \ac{SCE} protocol. If only a single photon was detected at the end of the protocol, the state of the two \acp{NV} would be $\ket\psi = \ket{\uparrow\downarrow} + e^{i\theta}\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}$, a maximally entangled state, where $\theta$ is the optical phase difference between the two photons. Since our detectors cannot discriminate between one or more incoming photons, the state of two \acp{NV} is actually, in the limit of small detection efficiency, $\rho = (1-\alpha)\ket\psi\bra\psi + \alpha\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}\bra{\uparrow\uparrow}$.

	b) A laser pulse resonant with the $\ket\uparrow$ state, entangles the state of photon with the state of each \ac{NV}.
	c) The two photonic modes interfere on a \ac{BS}.
	d) The detection of a single photon heralds the entanglement between the \acp{NV}.}

\section{Genuine remote multipartite entanglement}
A two-particle state can either be entangled or separable. When three or more particles are involved in the state, there are more possibilities. The state can be fully separable, where each of the systems can be described independently of the others, partially separable, where some systems are entangled with each other but not all of them are, and genuinely entangled, where none of the systems are separable from each other.
It is possible further to categorise genuinely entangled states: if it is possible to transform one state into another via \ac{SLOOC}, then we say that the two states are \ac{SLOOC}-equivalent.

There are two such categories of triparite genuinely entangled states: the ones that are \ac{SLOOC}-equivalent to the \ac{GHZ} state, $\ket{\text{GHZ}} = \ket{000} + \ket{111}$, and the ones that can be transformed into the W state, $\ket{\text{W}} = \ket{001} + \ket{010} + \ket{100}$. While the W state has the interesting feature of maintaining entanglement even if one of the parties is lost, the \ac{GHZ} is usually considered more powerful and most quantum network protocols require a GHZ state. 

Generation of remote GHZ states have been demonstrated on the photonic platform \cite{Bouwmeester1999}, and local GHZ states have been generated with \ac{NV} centres.

\subsection{Courses}
I attended (or I am currently attending) the following courses:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collaboration across disciplines (2 GSC) \todo{Ask Sandrine!}
	\item PhD Start-up (2 GSC)
	\item Conversation skills (2 GSC)
	\item Casimir Course - Programming (5 GSC)
	\item Casimir Course - Electronics for Physicists (5 GSC)
	\item QuTech Academy - Quantum Communication and Cryptography (5 GSC)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supervision}
I have been supervising Hans K. C. Beukers, a MSc student, since February 2018. Hans has been working on setup improvements and techniques that, if successful, will increase the lifetime of our memory qubits.

\subsection{Outreach}
As an \ac{ESR} in the \ac{MSCA} \ac{ITN} Spin-NANO, I have to carry out outreach activities regarding my research field to the wider audience. I have currently carried out two outreach activities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item January 2018, Sheffield, UK. Introduction to quantum- and nano-technologies to local high-school students, as part of an \ac{ITN} meeting. \todo{1 GSC?}
	\item September 2018, Brussels, BE. Two days stand about quantum technologies at the European Researchers Night, EU Parlamentarium, mainly to children between 5 and 10. \todo{2 GSC?}
\end{itemize}
